				<h3 class="title"> <h3 class="second-article-text"> History </h3>
				<p> The region was first inhabited by the aboriginal Negritos, before they were pushed by successive waves of Austronesian immigrants that penetrated the narrow coast. Tingguians in the interior, Ilocanos in the north, Pangasinans in the south, and Zambals in the southwestern most areas settled the region. Before the administration of Ferdinand Marcos, Pangasinan was not a part of the region.
				In 1901, the region came under American colonial rule, and in 1941, under Japanese occupation. <br>
				During 1945, the combined American and the Philippine Commonwealth troops including with the Ilocano and Pangasinan guerillas liberated the Ilocos Region from Japanese forces during the Second World War. <br>
				Several presidents of the Republic of the Philippines hailed from the Region:  Elpidio Quirino, Ferdinand Marcos, and Fidel V. Ramos.

				<div class="watch"> <h3 class="second-article-text"> Luna Watch Tower </h3>
				<p> Luna, known as the Pebble Capital of the North. Its coast facing the West Philippine Sea seems to be a bottomless repository of pebbles of various sizes and colors that are washed in from the ocean. Along this strip stands a 5.6-meter tall watch tower called "Baluarte"  that has survived pirate attacks, a war among countries, and even a devastating typhoon.
				It is made of adobe and coral blocks held together by lime and egg whites. This is why it wasn't surprising that the tower was eventually split into two. <br><br><br> </p> </div>

				<div class="bahay"></div>
				<div class="bato"> <h3 class="second-article-text"> Bahay na Bato </h3>
